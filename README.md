<h2>üéØ The goal</h2>
<p>The goal of the project was to develop a web application based on a given requirement: to create a database and a web app that allows users to register and apply for job positions. Users can also take tests and receive scores. The web app includes an admin page where administrators can create, open, close, and modify job positions, as well as create technical tests specific to each open position. Once an admin closes a position, the web app displays the candidate with the highest score.</p>
<h2>üë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥ The process</h2>
<p>The development process began with <b>designing the database</b>, where we identified the essential tables and defined the relationships between them. We carefully planned the entities and their associations to ensure a scalable and well-structured foundation for managing the data.

Next, we moved on to defining the project structure. This involved creating the necessary entities, developing classes, and setting up the controllers and corresponding JSP. To enhance the user experience, we utilized <b>Bootstrap</b> for styling and creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces.

Finally, we implemented an <b>authentication</b> and authorization system by adding <b>filters</b> to manage access based on <b>user</b> and <b>admin</b> roles. This allowed us to differentiate access rights: admins could manage job positions and quizzes, while regular users could apply for positions and complete the associated tests.
